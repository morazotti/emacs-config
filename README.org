#+STARTUP: overview

Hello! This is another overhaul of my init system in emacs, making use
of distinct files for each configuration part. In this setup, I'm
going to use the following structure to separate each file:

- ~modules/core~ contains the necessary parts of the system, such as
  package managing and general configurations.
- ~modules/org~ contains all the configuration for ~org-mode~, which I
  use daily.

* ~core~
- ~core.el~ loads the necessary files.

#+transclude: [[file:modules/core/core.el]]  :src elisp

- ~packages.el~ bootstraps ~straight.el~ and sets up ~use-package~ as
  package manager.

  #+transclude: [[file:modules/core/packages.el]]  :src elisp
